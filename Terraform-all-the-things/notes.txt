* Yelp tried many tools to automate/script AWS operations
* Settled on Terraform
* Why not CloudFormation is you're with AWS?
  * Vendor lockin!!!!
* Terraform also configured
  * NS1
  * Fastly
  * Cloudflare
  * signalfx
  * Yelp used all of these as well
* Projects for differnt Terraform projects are split up by directory
  * project / region is a pattern they use.
* also seperated DNS terraform out, was taking too long to do it!
* Used Zoopkeeper to keep their statefile in as a locking mechanism
* Decided to wrap all Terraform ops into a Makefile
