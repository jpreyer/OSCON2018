* What is Blockchain?
  * Hash function
    * Takes input
    * Outputs a fixed sized string
    * output is unique to input
    * Idempotent
    * Infeasible to invert (cannot reverse engineer!)

* Public Key (asymmetric) Encryption
    * 2 keys: public and private

* Block attributes
    * Cryptographic hash of the previous block
    * creation date timestamp
    * Data (each block stores the owner's public key)

* What is the block"chain"
  * A data structure
  * Glorified linked list with only append function
  * Decentralized / Distributed / Public

* Adding a block
  * Submit transaction
  * generate the Block
  * network determines if the block is part of the authoritative Blockchain

* Consensus
  * 2 users can have different correct copies of data
  * Reconciled by having a higher value chain (consensus algorithm)
  * Blockchains must be Byzantine Fault Tolerant
  * typically based on higher proof of work or proof of stake
